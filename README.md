# DNHS 3D Development Club - 2022 Project #1

_Maintained by Daniel Tsivkovski, Secretary of DNHS 3D Development Club_

This is the repository for the Del Norte High School 3D Development Club's first Y2022 Project. It includes code that is caught up with all of the club's meetings and may be referenced for those who are behind and need to check differences in code that may otherwise be difficult to find.
